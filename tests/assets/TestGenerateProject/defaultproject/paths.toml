# This is the paths file. This is where you'll define your project's folder structure.
# Just add tables in TOML's format, like this:
# 
# [animals.dogs]
# [animals.dogs.images]
# [animals.cats]
# [animals.cats.images]
# [contact]
# 
# You'll end up with the following website structure (rooted in the output folder):
#
# animals/
# animals/dogs/
# animals/dogs/images/
# animals/cats/
# animals/cats/images/
# contact/
