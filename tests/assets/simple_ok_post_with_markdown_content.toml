Markdown is a **lightweight markup language** used to format plain text. It's simple to use and can be converted to HTML or other formats. Below are some key features of markdown:

### 1. Headers
You can create headers by using the `#` symbol:
- `#` for a main header (H1)
- `##` for a subheader (H2)
- `###` for a smaller header (H3), and so on.

Example:
```markdown
# This is an H1
## This is an H2
